## Installation of Linux Mint 18.2 Cinnamon, Mate or Xfce

We start from an up-to-date and clean install of Linux Mint 18.2 Cinnamon, XFCE or MATE as described on

The installation of 18.1 and 18.2 are identical.

# F  A  Q
--------------------

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename

Or you can follow these steps
